Product Requirements Document (PRD): The Word Registry
Version: 3.0 (Final Web Specification)
Status: Approved for Development
Platform: Web (Mobile Responsive) + API (Headless)
Core Concept: A competitive marketplace for exclusive, temporary ownership of
English words.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Word Registry is a gamified e-commerce platform where users purchase
"ownership" of English words. It operates on a "Steal & Shield" economy:
ownership is never permanent; it is protected only for a duration proportional
to the purchase price.

The platform serves two distinct user bases:

1. Humans: Via a high-end, minimalist web interface.
2. AI Agents: Via the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), allowing autonomous
bots to discover, value, and purchase words without human intervention.
3. CORE GAME MECHANICS (THE "PHYSICS")

2.1 The Economy (Uncapped Volatility)

* Inventory Source: Approximately 480,000 words imported from open-source
  dictionaries (e.g., dwyl/english-words).
* Base Price: All unsold words start at $1.00.
* The Price Escalator: Every valid sale increases the price of that specific
  word by exactly $1.00 for the next buyer.
* Mechanism: Price can rise infinitely. There is no hard cap.
* Revenue: The platform retains 100% of all transaction volume.

2.2 The Lockout (The "Shield")

* Concept: Purchasing a word grants a temporary "Shield" during which it
  cannot be bought by others.
* Formula: 1 Hour of Protection per $1.00 Spent.
* Spend $1.00 = Safe for 1 Hour.
* Spend $24.00 = Safe for 24 Hours.
* Spend $100.00 = Safe for 4 Days, 4 Hours.


* Expiry: Once the timer hits 00:00:00, the status reverts to AVAILABLE, but
  the price remains at the high water mark.

2.3 The Asset (What is Owned)
In exchange for the fee, the owner receives:

1. Digital Billboard: Their Name and Custom Message displayed on the word's
permanent URL (e.g.,
[registry.com/word/serendipity](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://registry.com/word/serendipity)).
2. Bank Statement Brag: The credit card statement descriptor dynamically reads
"WR* [WORD]" (e.g., WR* LOVE).
3. History Log: Permanent entry in the "Previous Owners" ledger on the page.
4. USER EXPERIENCE (HUMAN)

3.1 Search & Discovery

* Landing Page: Minimalist design featuring a "Random Word" generator (only
  pulls available $1.00 words) and a search bar.
* Live Ticker (The Top 10): A real-time leaderboard showing "Most Searched"
  and "Most Expensive" words.
* Visual Status:
* Available: Green "Claim This Word" button.
* Locked: Gold "Secured by [Name]" badge with a live Countdown Timer.



3.2 The Checkout Flow (Compliance-Focused)

1. Initiation: User clicks "Claim for $[X]".
2. Input: User enters Owner Name and Message (Max 140 characters).
3. Sanitation Check: System validates text against blocklists (see Section 5).
4. Mandatory Acknowledgement:
* UI: An unchecked box required to proceed.
* Text: "I acknowledge that I am purchasing temporary ownership. My rights to
  this word expire in [X] hours, after which it may be purchased by another
user."


5. Payment: Redirect to Stripe Checkout.
6. Success: User is returned to the Word Page, which instantly updates with
confetti and the new owner details.
7. AGENTIC EXPERIENCE (AI / UCP)

4.1 Capabilities Manifest
The site must host a /.well-known/ai-plugin.json file declaring:

* Identity: "The Word Registry - A marketplace for unique string ownership."
* Capabilities: Search, Check Availability, Purchase.

4.2 API Endpoints

* GET /api/ucp/products?q={word}
Returns structured JSON with:
* price: Current float value.
* status: "LOCKED" or "AVAILABLE".
* lockout_ends: ISO timestamp (if locked).


* POST /api/ucp/checkout
Accepts payment token and owner metadata; returns transaction hash.

5. CONTENT MODERATION & SAFETY

5.1 The Inventory (The Words)

* Policy: Unrestricted.
* Detail: The platform sells the entire English dictionary, including
  profanity, slang, and controversial terms. We do not censor the product.

5.2 User-Generated Content (The Messages)

* Policy: Strict Family-Friendly.
* Prohibited Content:
1. Hate Speech/Profanity: Zero tolerance.
2. External Links: No URLs (.com, http), handles (@user), or IP addresses.
3. PII: No email addresses or phone numbers.


* Enforcement: Pre-purchase validation logic. If the regex detects a link or
  profanity, the "Pay" button remains disabled with an error message.

6. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

6.1 Stack

* Backend: Python (FastAPI). Best for UCP JSON handling and fast async logic.
* Database: PostgreSQL. Required for ACID transactions (preventing race
  conditions on popular words).
* Frontend: Next.js (React). Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is critical for SEO
  so individual word pages get indexed.
* Payments: Stripe (Checkout Sessions).

6.2 Data Model (Key Schemas)

* Word Table: text (Indexed), price, owner_name, owner_message,
  lockout_ends_at.
* Transaction Table: word_id, buyer_name, price_paid, timestamp. (Immutable
  log for history).

7. COMPLIANCE, LEGAL & MARKETING

7.1 Google Merchant Center (GMC) Strategy

* Feed Logic: The XML feed sent to Google Shopping will ONLY contain words
  priced at $1.00 (Base Price).
* Pruning: As soon as a word is sold (Price > $1.00), it is automatically
  removed from the Google Feed to prevent "Price Mismatch" suspensions.

7.2 Cookie Consent (GDPR/CCPA)

* Implementation: A banner on first load.
* Copy: "We use cookies to manage your cart and analyze site traffic."
* Options: [Accept Necessary] / [Accept All].

7.3 Legal Disclaimer

* Footer Text: "Ownership is a digital novelty service for entertainment
  purposes only. Purchase does not convey legal trademark rights, copyright,
or exclusivity over the English language outside of this platform."

8. DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

Phase P0 (Critical):

* Database & Import: Setup Postgres; Script to ingest 480k words.
* Core Logic API: function steal_word() handling Price +$1 and Lockout
  calculations.
* Payment Integration: Stripe Checkout with Dynamic Statement Descriptors (WR*
  WORD).

Phase P1 (High Priority):

* Frontend (Human): Next.js pages for Home, Word Detail, and Leaderboard.
* Compliance: Cookie Banner + Mandatory Checkout Checkbox.

Phase P2 (Medium Priority):

* Agentic Layer: UCP Manifest and JSON-LD structured data.
* GMC Feed: XML generation script for the "Available $1.00" subset.
